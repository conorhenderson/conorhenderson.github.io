Welcome to the personal webpage of Conor Henderson, particle physicist and novice github user

I am an Associate Professor in the [Physics Department](https://www.artsci.uc.edu/departments/physics.html) at the [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/).
I received my undergraduate degree in physics & applied mathematics from [Queen's University, Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk/), Northern Ireland, and my [PhD in physics](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/34393) from [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/).
After postdoctoral research appointments with [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/lns/index.html) and as a [CERN](https://home.cern/) Research Fellow, I joined the faculty of the [University of Alabama](https://www.ua.edu/). In 2021, I moved to the University of Cincinnati.
