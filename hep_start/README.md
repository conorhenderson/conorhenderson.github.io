# Getting Started in Experimental High Energy Physics

The following links and resources are intended to be useful for students getting started in experimental high-energy physics with the Large Hadron Collider.

## Introduction to HEP Detectors

The [Particle Data Group](https://pdg.lbl.gov/) Reviews on Experimental Methods are a great resource to learn about HEP detector technologies; just be aware that they are not 
necessarily written at the intro level.
Start with the ['Passage of Particles Through Matter'](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2023/web/viewer.html?file=../reviews/rpp2023-rev-passage-particles-matter.pdf), 
then consult ['Particle Detectors at Accelerators'](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2023/web/viewer.html?file=../reviews/rpp2023-rev-particle-detectors-accel.pdf)
(Note: the direct links provided here are for the 2023 versions which may not be the most up-to-date at the time you are viewing this)

<!-- Can I find a more gentle intro to HEP detectors? Perhaps from a summer school? -->
