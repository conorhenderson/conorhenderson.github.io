# Getting Started in Experimental High Energy Physics

The following links and resources are intended to be useful for students getting started in experimental high-energy physics with the Large Hadron Collider.

## Introduction to HEP Detectors

The [Particle Data Group](https://pdg.lbl.gov/) Reviews on Experimental Methods are a great resource to learn about HEP detector technologies; just be aware that they are not 
necessarily written at the intro level.
Start with the ['Passage of Particles Through Matter'](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2023/web/viewer.html?file=../reviews/rpp2023-rev-passage-particles-matter.pdf)
then consult ['Particle Detectors at Accelerators'](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2023/web/viewer.html?file=../reviews/rpp2023-rev-particle-detectors-accel.pdf)
(Note: the direct links provided here are for the 2023 versions which may not be the most up-to-date at the time you are viewing this)

<!-- Can I find a more gentle intro to HEP detectors? Perhaps from a summer school? -->

 Your fundamental goals from this reading should be:
 * get a basic idea of ionization energy loss for charged particles, and the Bethe-Bloch formula
 * become familiar with the processes of pair production and bremsstrahlung
 * understand how electromagnetic and hadronic showers evolve
 * understand basic characteristics such as radiation length
 * understand the fundamental concepts of the following detector technologies:
     * silicon detectors
     * electromagnetic calorimeters
     * hadronic calorimeters
     * Drift chambers and TPCs
     * scintillation detectors
     * Cherenkov detectors
     * photon detectors
  * be in a position to see how these various technologies may be combined and utilised in any specific collider detector such as LHCb

For a specific LHC experiment, the most detailed document on the detector construction is probably the Journal of Instrumentation paper from the LHC volume in 2008 - for LHCb, that paper is here: https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/3/08/S08005 <br>
Note that this describes the detector prior to the LHC starting up, and there have been numerous upgrades since. 
For LHCb, the upgrades are summarised in the following Framework Technical Design Reports (TDRs): 
* [Framework TDR for the LHCb Upgrade (2012)](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1443882)
* [Framework TDR for the LHCb Upgrade II (2021)](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2776420?ln=en)

Also helpful are previous PhD theses. The CERN Document Server hosts submitted LHC theses, organised by experiment. For LHCb, that collection is:
[LHCb Theses collection on the CERN Document Server (CDS)](https://cds.cern.ch/collection/LHCb%20Theses?ln=en&as=1)
